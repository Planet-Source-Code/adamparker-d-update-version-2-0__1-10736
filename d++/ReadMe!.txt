Welcome to the D++ Programming language.  This readme file
will tell you how to install and use D++ language.

Getting it installed:
-Unzip the ZIP file if you haven't already.
-Copy the DPPAPP.dll file to your System directory (e.g., C:\Windows\System)
-Open the D++ Compiler.
-If you get an error, make sure the DLL file is named exactly 
DPPAPP.dll and put in the system folder.

The D++ language:
It's best if you are already familiar with the language to use
D++.  Here's a list of commands and what they do.

screenout "";  			-Place any text you want between the quotes, and 
				it will output it to the user.

screenin (variable), "";	-This is he input, and where (variable) is, this
				is where you put your variable.  Between the quotes,
				enter the prompt for the user.

screen;				-indicates going to the next line.

title "";			-Titles the application what is in the quotes, and 
				places the title into the title bar in the console.

delete "";			-Deletes the file specified within the quotes.

box "", "";			-Creates a message box, the text being in the first
				quotes, and the title in the second quotes.

pause?;				-Replace the ? with the interval you wish to pause.

end;				-Ends the program at it's current position.

<...>				-This is the comment, which everything between < and >
				is ignored by the compiler.

time;                           -Gets the time

date;                           -Gets the date

wav "";				-Plays a sound in that directory

That's all the commands there are right now.
